Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions
Some languages try to bring new ideas into old programming domains, such as by running on a VM designed for a different language. Developers for languages ranging from C and Java to Perl and PHP pull themselves out of a rut by retroactively incorporating ideas that other languages popularized. And some languages, such as R, remain defiantly unique in their syntax and data structures.
The factors driving new languages include new and faster hardware, new types of applications, new environments (such as graphical displays and the web), and deeper understandings of computer science.
Changes in business goals can also drive language development. Over the past 20 years, the field of programming has been challenged to improve in numerous ways: to release new features faster and fas
ter, eliminate errors that cause failures or breaches, and work within bigger and more diverse teams. Such business evolution leads to new forms of human interaction such as Agile and continuous development, then to new tools to support those behaviors, and ultimately to new languages and hardware.
any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some “higher-level” language. Although there are many computer languages, relatively few are widely used.
